Movie Mania (at least that's the name for now)

This is an app about movies.

Hoping to find a good API to get a list of movies.
Movie names are used as search parameters to Twitter REST API (get/search) to retrieve recent tweets on these movies

Definitely want to use Backbone, jQuery
Codebird is a JS library for making Twitter REST API calls, seems to be doing the trick so far
